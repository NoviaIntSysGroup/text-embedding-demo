1;Maritime Digital Twin architecture: A concept for holistic Digital Twin application for shipbuilding and shipping;26;2021;Jan-Erik Giering, Alexander Dyck; Automatisierungstechnik;Digital Twins (DTs) play an important role in current digitalization trends across industries. As maritime markets are particularly affected by recent global tendencies such as increasing delivery costs or political pressure for decarbonization, DT solutions could provide important support for shipbuilding and shipping companies to master recent and upcoming challenges. This paper provides a brief insight into the current state of the maritime industry and shows possible use-cases for DT Ship applications throughout the entire product lifecycle. To further advance the general understanding of DTs and their implementation, the concept of a Maritime Digital Twin Architecture (MDTA) is proposed to structure practical DT features.;"Maritime Digital Twin Architecture; shipping; shipbuilding; digitalization; digital twin; product lifecycle management"

The concept of the digital twin is becoming popular, and it is adopted for ship operation systems in this study. In particular, this paper introduces a new and innovative concept of the digital twin to predict ocean waves and hydrodynamic performances, such as seakeeping and maneuvering, which enables the risk and optimum route to be forecast in real time. An essential element in the realization of such a real-time digital twin is the real-time prediction of ocean waves. Hence, a sophisticated algorithm for wave reconstruction using measured wave-radar images is developed, which is extended to predicting the future evolution of a three-dimensional wave field in front of a ship within a time window of the order of 10 min. As another essential element, an analysis program to solve the coupled seakeeping-maneuvering problem is developed. This analysis can also be used in real time. By combining this with wave prediction software, the future occurrence of ocean waves and ship responses can be predicted. By extending this approach, the risk and performance of ships in various ocean environments can be predicted. In this paper, concepts, approaches, and examples are introduced.;"Digital twin; Ship operation in waves; Real-time prediction; Wave prediction; Seakeeping-maneuvering coupled simulation"
3;Real-time digital twin of research vessel for remote monitoring;16;2021;"Major, Pierre Yann; Li, Guoyuan; Zhang, Houxiang; Hildre, Hans Petter";Proceedings of 35th European Council for Modelling and Simulation;Real-time digital twins of ships in operation find many applications such as predictive maintenance, climbing the ladders of ship autonomy, and offshore operational excellence. The literature describes a focus on digital twinning of individual equipment such as navigation, propulsion, engine and power system, or crane. Yet, digital twinning and virtual prototyping for offshore operations are in their infancy and the onboard digitisation hardware and the telecommunication infrastructure are becoming accessible and affordable. Previous work has failed to address the need for building a holistic model and thus contextualising the equipment with the state of the whole vessel. A prototype of an online digital twin of a research vessel is proposed, its architecture described and its suitability for virtual prototyping demonstrated in a remote control centre. The study shows a viable proof of concept for remote monitoring and crew assistance in nominal and contingency response for offshore crane operations.;"Virtual Prototyping; Digital Twin; Remote Monitoring"
4;Digital Twin in the Maritime Domain: A Review and Emerging Trends;6;2023;Nuwan Sri Madusanka,Yijie Fan,Shaolong Yang and Xianbo Xiang;J. Mar. Sci. Eng.;This paper highlights the development of Digital Twin (DT) technology and its admittance to a variety of applications within the maritime domain in general and surface ships in particular. The conceptual theory behind the evolution of DT is highlighted along with the development of the technology and current progress in practical applications with an exploration of the key milestones in the extension from the electrification of the shipping sector towards the realization of a definitive DT-based system. Existing DT-based applications within the maritime sector are surveyed along with the comprehension of ongoing research work. The development strategy for a formidable DT architecture is discussed, culminating in a proposal of a four-layered DT framework. Considering the importance of DT, an extensive and methodical literature survey has also been carried out, along with a comprehensive scientometric analysis to unveil the methodical footprint of DT in the marine sector, thus leading the way for future work on the design, development and operation of surface vessels using DT applications.;"digital twin; digitalization; smart shipping; autonomous surface vehicles; citespace; scientometric analysis"
5;From digital twin to maritime data space: Transparent ownership and use of ship information;16;;Ørnulf Jan Rødseth, Arne J. Berre;Proc. 13th Int. Symp. Integr. Ship’s Inf. Syst. Mar. Traffic Eng. Conf.(ISIS-MTE);"The concept of the digital twin is gaining momentum in the maritime industry, but it brings with it new questions about data ownership and governance. Given the wide range of different data that can be stored in the digital twin, it is not clear if all these data can be stored in the same data base or even use the same governance model. Within the Industrie 4.0 framework, a concept called ""Industrial Data Space"" (IDS) has been developed to cater to these problems for land-based industry. With the advent of ""Shipping 4.0"" as the Industrie 4.0 of the seas, we propose a similar concept as IDS for the maritime world, called ""Maritime Data Space"" (MDS). This will be an extension of IDS but will be adapted to the specific nature of shipping and, hence, a modified digital trust framework, lower connectivity for ships at sea and the highly heterogenous control and physical systems architecture on ships. However, MDS will still be a part of the IDS ecosystem and gain benefit from the further developments in IDS and its applications.";
6;Data-driven ship digital twin for estimating the speed loss caused by the marine fouling;169;2019;Andrea Coraddu, Luca Oneto, Francesco Baldi, Francesca Cipollini, Mehmet Atlar, Stefano Savio;Ocean Engineering;Shipping is responsible for approximately the 90% of world trade leading to significant impacts on the environment. As a consequence, a crucial issue for the maritime industry is to develop technologies able to increase the ship efficiency, by reducing fuel consumption and unnecessary maintenance operations. For example, the marine fouling phenomenon has a deep impact, since to prevent or reduce its growth which affects the ship consumption, costly drydockings for cleaning the hull and the propeller are needed and must be scheduled based on a speed loss estimation. In this work a data driven Digital Twin of the ship is built, leveraging on the large amount of information collected from the on-board sensors, and is used for estimating the speed loss due to marine fouling. A thorough comparison between the proposed method and ISO 19030, which is the de-facto standard for dealing with this task, is carried out on real-world data coming from two Handymax chemical/product tankers. Results clearly show the effectiveness of the proposal and its better speedloss prediction accuracy with respect to the ISO 19030, thus allowing reducing the fuel consumption due to fouling.;"Hull and propeller maintenance; Fouling; Condition based maintenance; ISO 19030; Digital twin; Data-Driven Models; Deep learning"
7;Challenges when creating a cohesive digital twin ship: a data modelling perspective;57;;Ícaro Aragão Fonseca, Henrique Murilo Gaspar;Schiffstechnik;A digital twin is a digital asset that simulates the behaviours of a physical counterpart. Digital twin ship literature identifies that the concept is already being applied to specialised problems, but no clear guide exists for creating broader interdisciplinary digital twins. Relevant dimensions of product data modelling and previous attempts at standardizing ship data elucidate the requirements for effective data modelling in a digital twin context. Such requirements are placed in a broader perspective for digital twin implementation that encompasses challenges and directions for future development of services, networks, and software. Finally, an open standardization for digital twin data is proposed based on lessons extracted from this panorama, proposing its application to a research vessel.;"digital twin; digital thread;‌simulation‌;product data modelling;data standard;open source;internet of things;digitalization‌"
8;The Digital Twin throughout the Lifecycle;20;2018;Jan Van Os;SNAME Maritime Convention, Providence, Rhode Island, USA, October 2018;This paper presents the future possibilities of the digital twin in the Maritime Industry and the solutions to optimize the use throughout the lifecycle of the vessel. Especially in relation to Autonomous vessels the Digital Twin will play a crucial role in optimal performance of a vessel. The Maritime industry is fragmented and the original builder of the Digital Twin, the shipyard, is in most cases not the owner who is operating the vessel for a period of 20 to 30 years. Also the class societies are part of this value chain and should adapt their approval process and inspection process to serve the Digital Twin. A collaboration between the parties involved is absolute necessary and will introduce a new view on the Maritime industry and new business models for the shipyards.;platform, collaboration, ship owner, maritime industry, digital twin, value chain, marine industry, operator, class society, shipbuilding

10;Digital Twin Modelling of Ship Power and Propulsion Systems: Application of the Open Simulation Platform;46;2020;"Florian Perabo; Daeseong Park; Mehdi Karbalaye Zadeh; Øyvind Smogeli; Levi Jamt";2020 IEEE 29th International Symposium on Industrial Electronics (ISIE);Today, modelling and simulation technologies are extensively used in the maritime industry. As a reaction to changing market demands and environmental challenges, maritime systems are becoming more complex and coupled. Digital approaches such as digital twins and co-simulation are coping these challenges and offer new opportunities throughout the lifecycle of a vessel. In this work, we present the digital twin modelling and the co-simulation of a typical AC ship power and propulsion system including the power stage, relevant local controllers and a high-level controller. The power and control components are modelled individually and exported as Functional Mock-up Units (FMUs). To perform a co-simulation of the ship electric power system, the Open Simulation Platform (OSP) is utilized. This co-simulation environment connects the individual FMUs and routes the data between the sub-simulators of the digital twin. A typical test scenario is carried out to demonstrate the correct functioning of the ship power and propulsion system as well as the OSP environment.;
11;Security in IoT-Enabled Digital Twins of Maritime Transportation Systems;26;2021;"Jun Liu; Chunlin Li; Jingpan Bai; Youlong Luo; Haibin Lv; Zhihan Lv";IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems;"The purposes are to explore the safety performance of the Maritime Transportation System (MTS) based on Digital Twins (DTs) Internet of Things (IoT) and develop maritime transportation towards intelligence and digitalization. Because the comprehensive operational security of modern MTS is not yet mature, historical transportation data of the Maritime Silk Road are acquired and preprocessed. Afterward, DTs are introduced, and relay nodes are added to data transmission paths to construct a maritime transportation DTs model based on relay cooperation IoT. Eventually, this model’s security performance is validated through simulation experiments. Relay security analysis suggests that interference information is a vital guarantee to assist in information non-disclosure, from which the constructed model can harvest energy to increase the data transmission power, thereby improving communication performance and secrecy rate. Outage probability analysis reveals that the simulated and the theoretical results are almost the same; moreover, given the system’s multi-hop paths in the same environment, the more the relays and the greater the fading index, the better the system performance and the lower the outage probability. Once the iterations reach a particular number, the node secrecy rate becomes optimal and cannot cause excessive burden to the system; besides, the power distribution can establish a new equilibrium when the nodes are in different locations, so that system security performance gets improved. The simulated value is closest to the actual result under 100% successful transmission probability and 0.01∼0.05 λ value. To sum up, the constructed maritime transportation DTs model presents extraordinary transmission and security performance, providing an experimental basis for intelligent and secure maritime transportation in the future.";Digital twins, maritime transportation system, Internet of Things, relay cooperation, maritime silk road
12;A Digital Twin of the Research Vessel Gunnerus for Lifecycle Services: Outlining Key Technologies;11;2022;"Houxiang Zhang; Guoyuan Li; Lars Ivar Hatledal; Yingguang Chu; André Ellefsen; Peihua Han; Pierre Major; Robert Skulsta";IEEE Robotics & Automation Magazine ;Digitalization has become a key aspect of making maritime industries more innovative, efficient, and fit for future operations. One of the most attractive aspects is the concept of digital twins , which refers to digital replicas of physical assets, processes, and systems that can be used as advanced tools for design, operation, and maintenance. This article introduces the development of the digital twin of the research vessel (RV) Gunnerus in Norway, which will be a significant scientific and operational achievement for the maritime industry, making efficient and safe offshore operations possible. It enables data exchange safely and easily among different subsystems, modules, and various applications. Thus, the twin ship can provide an integrated view of the ship’s various physical and behavioral aspects in different stages and allow simultaneous optimization of functional performance requirements. In addition, it enables advanced control and optimization, e.g., creating more reliable prediction for flexible objectives (time, output, emissions, fuel consumption), and executing day-ahead and long-term planning for operations. Several related applications are presented in the end to confirm the effectiveness of the digital twin ship system.;advanced tools,attractive aspects,concept ofdigital twins,digital replicas,digital twin ship system,digitalization,future operations,lifecycle services,maritime industry,offshore operations,operational achievement, outlining key technologies, physical assets, research vessel gunnerus, research vessel,Gunnerusin Norway, significant scientific achievement
13;Digital twin for ship life-cycle: A critical systematic review;17;2023;F. Mauro, A.A. Kana;Ocean Engineering;The focus on digitalisation in manufacturing is spreading to other industry fields, including large and complex objects like ships. Such interest introduces the concept of Digital Twins in supporting designers and operators through the whole ship-life cycle. However, the term Digital Twin is typically abused in the shipping industry, many times erroneously referring to any virtual version of a model-based system as a Digital Twin of the ship. The mutual data exchange between the physical and virtual environment, which is the basis of a true Digital Twin, is mostly missing, confusing a virtual model with a sophisticated living virtual environment. Few reviews are available in the literature for Digital Twins on ships. This systematic review proposes the identification of weaknesses and correlations between current Digital Twin applications in the maritime industry and other industry fields. Furthermore, the methodology applied here may be repeated in future studies to provide a fair and objective overview of the research advancements in the topic. The study highlighted how literature scarcely addresses the design and decommissioning phases, indicating that research should focus on these topics, especially concerning the design of future ships.;Digital twin, Ship life-cycle, Industry 4.0, Literature review, Digital transition

15;A Standards-Based Digital Twin of an Experiment with a Scale Model Ship;18;2022;Ícaro Aragão Fonseca, Henrique Murilo Gaspar, Pedro Cardozo de Mello, Humberto Akira Uehara Sasaki;Computer-Aided Design;We propose the use of existing data standards and web technologies to modeling and development of digital twin ships. Our research provides an open framework that can be linked to services such as visualizations, simulations and remote control. The case study applies the standards-based framework to an experiment that involved a scale model ship equipped with a dynamic positioning system under artificial waves. The digital twin prototype illustrated the capability of mirroring and controlling the model’s position in real-time, and predicting motion responses across wave conditions via a web application. Thus, it closes the loop between test and design in the life cycle by allowing validation of results in comparison to empirical data during operation. The results from these experiments are used to discuss an expanded version of the digital twin for validation and optimization of motion response, as well as its implications to the system’s (ship) taxonomy and data management. The conclusion summarizes lessons when using the adopted standards, as well as challenges when scaling the approach to real life operations. Future research is proposed toward extending the standardization to more complex cases.;Digital twinSimulationData standardInternet of thingsShipRemote operations

17;Ship digital twin architecture for optimizing sailing automation;1;2023;Omer Kemal Kinaci;Ocean Engineering;"A fully autonomous ship should be monitored in a digital environment to track its real-time response to the changes in its surroundings. It is commanded by a controller algorithm whose optimum parameters is subject to change with respect to the changes in the environment. The ship's response with respect to these variations in the controller parameters need to be tracked to develop a full understanding of the ship's autonomy. As such, it is believed that the digital twin of a ship is an essential component of the path to fully autonomous ships. Despite maritime institutions not giving the credit to it yet, the ship digital twin concept is expected to be one of the leading topics in marine engineering soon. In this study, we try to establish the ship digital twin concept in terms of navigation autonomy. The paper starts by introducing the path to full autonomy in seas and the need for the digital twin by defining this concept for ships. A maneuvering mathematical model is used to represent the physical ship. The details of the model and the controller algorithms are given next. The propeller and rudder models are first validated by free-running self-propulsion and turning circle tests. The ship considered in this study has a twisted rudder and does not possess course-keeping ability; therefore, it requires autopilot to move straight ahead. Three types of simulation cases are identified with one being the autopilot mode. In the other two cases, the ship is forced to conduct two hard maneuvers while accelerating/decelerating. Investigation of the generated results reveals the effectiveness of the digital twin architecture used in this study. It has also allowed us to conduct a controller stability analysis, which has shown the behavior of the controller gains to detect the most optimum values for the considered model ship.";Maritime digital twinAutonomous shipLevel 2 autonomyMaritime autonomous surface ships

We utilize the interaction between virtual and physical entities to improve the flexibility and adaptability of the network, aiming at more efficient maritime network resource management and optimization. We then discuss the main challenges and some potential research issues in DT-assisted marine network design. The proposed maritime networking architecture based on DT can provide a good reference for network planning and deployment of maritime networking architecture to adapt to different marine environments.;maritime network,digital twin,virtual simulation
20;Ship’s Digital Twin—A Review of Modelling Challenges and Applications;13;2022;Nur Assani ,Petar Matić and Marko Katalinić;Applied sciences;"Abstract
The Ship’s Digital Twin (SDT) is a digital record of a ship’s behaviour or a software clone, which can be used to simulate scenarios that are expensive or hardly feasible to perform on a real object and especially in real time. The purpose of the SDT is to achieve cost reduction, obtain timely warnings of irregularities, and optimise individual ship system performances or the operation of the whole ship and to assist ship management. The aim of this paper is to describe the concept of the SDT and clarify some perplexities that may occur from initial introduction to concept. To that end, the paper identifies the steps in the SDT formulation process and methods used in each step of the process. Furthermore, a four-step iterative procedure for the SDT development is proposed. The applications of the concept are numerous, and some of them are presented in a review analysis in this paper. The presented analysis leads to a conclusion that should give some direction to future research in this area.";"ship; digital twin; development procedure; modelling methods; applications; review analysis"
21;Towards Integrated Digital-Twins: An Application Framework for Autonomous Maritime Surface Vessel Development;3;2022;Minahil Raza,Hanna Prokopova,Samir Huseynzade,Sepinoud Azimi, Sebastien Lafond;Journal of Marine Science and Engineering;The use of digital twins for the development of Autonomous Maritime Surface Vessels (AMSVs) has enormous potential to resolve the increasing need for water-based navigation and safety at the sea. Aiming at the problem of lack of broad and integrated digital twin implementations with live data along with the absence of a digital twin-driven framework for AMSV design and development, an application framework for the development of a fully autonomous vessel using an integrated digital twin in a 3D simulation environment has been presented. Our framework has 4 layers which ensure that simulation and real-world vessel and the environment are as close as possible. Åboat, an in-house, experimental research platform for maritime automation and autonomous surface vessel applications, equipped with two trolling electric motors, cameras, LiDARs, IMU and GPS has been used as the case study to provide a proof of concept. Åboat, its sensors, and the environment have been replicated in a commercial, 3D simulation environment, AILiveSim. Using the proposed application framework, we develop obstacle detection and path planning systems based on machine learning which leverage live data from a 3D simulation environment to mirror the complex dynamics of the real world. Exploiting the proposed application framework, the rewards across training episodes of a Deep Reinforcement Learning model are evaluated for live simulated data in AILiveSim.;"maritime autonomy; autonomous ship; safety; digital twin; deep reinforcement learning; collision avoidance; situational awareness"
22;Taking Control of the Digital Twin;14;2017;"Marcus Bole; Gabriel Powell; Eric Rousseau";SNAME Maritime Convention (p. D023S004R002). SNAME.;"The rise of digital documentation has given the marine industry the ability to capture more information than ever about the ships and facilities we produce and operate. While this should make management of these assets more effective, the ease in which information can be created often means that we find ourselves unable to find the information we're searching for. As constituent engineering systems become more complex, integrated and autonomous the need to retain documentation that describes operation becomes necessary for efficient maintenance and resolving unforeseen situations. Digital Twin's address this challenge by retaining and publishing documentation, but a key principle is the efficient means to find data to ensure relevance and reduced searching time.

For several years, AVEVA has been exploiting the opportunity to link asset documentation together using contextual themes to create a connected dataset which allows quick identification of critical and related information. This has resulted in several Digital Twin interfaces that deploy information into different scenarios and devices, from handheld personal devices to large format screens for team decision support. Using these tools our customers can maintain their vessel, expose trends in data and provide insight into ways their asset may be changing over time.";software, interface, representation, information management, knowledge, artificial intelligence, documentation, aveva, browser, maintenance
23;Machine learning enhancement of manoeuvring prediction for ship Digital Twin using full-scale recordings;17;2022;Rasmus E. Nielsen, Dimitrios Papageorgiou, Lazaros Nalpantidis, Bugge T. Jensen, Mogens Blanke;Ocean Engineering;Digital Twins have much attention in the shipping industry, attempting to support all phases of a vessel’s life cycle. With several tools appearing in Digital Twin software suites, high-quality manoeuvring and performance prediction remain cornerstones. Propulsion efficiency is in focus while in service. Simulator-based training is in focus to ensure safety of manoeuvring in confined waters and harbours. Prediction of ships’ velocity and turn rate are essential for correct look and feel during training, but phenomena like dynamic inflow to propellers, bank and shallow water effects limit simulators’ accuracy, and master mariners often comment that simulations could be in better agreement with actual behaviours of their vessel. This paper focuses on digital twin enhancements to better match reality. Using data logged during in-service operation, we first consider a system identification perspective, employing a first-principles model structure. Showing that a complete first-principles model is not identifiable under the excitation met in service, we employ a Recurrent Neural Network to predict deviations between measured velocities and the model output. The outcome is a hybrid of a first-principles model with a machine learning generic approximator add-on. The paper demonstrates significant improvements in prediction accuracy of both in-harbour manoeuvring and shallow water passage conditions.;Digital Twin, Machine learning, Ship motion prediction, Ship performance prediction, System identification, Manoeuvring simulation, Manoeuvring model

26;Systems engineering and digital twin: a vision for the future of cruise ships design, production and operations;47;2019;Vincenzo Arrichiello & Paola Gualeni;International Journal on Interactive Design and Manufacturing (IJIDeM) ;Cruise ships are among the most complex and demanding products of the shipbuilding industry. The very special “payload” and exclusive operational profile, i.e. passengers looking for leisure and entertainment, imply outstanding performances in terms of safety standards and customer satisfaction. Attention to environment is relevant as well, since these ships are used to operate in spectacular marine ecosystems. The need of European shipyards to continuously progress to preserve the market leadership requires a virtuous evolution of the ship design process projected on a life cycle perspective. In this regard Systems Engineering appears to be a robust and reliable paradigm, able to provide the necessary comprehensive view of the cruise ship system as a whole together with a systematic methodological framework that, among the other advantages, enables the active and constructive participation of all the involved stakeholders in the decision-making process. In particular, Systems Engineering strongly relies on the so-called model-based engineering to share, integrate, combine and improve the level of details relevant to the system under development. In this paper the digital twin model will be discussed as a natural evolution of above-mentioned model-based engineering and its utilization in the shipbuilding field will be described as a very promising application especially in the field of cruise ships.;Digital twin, Systems engineering, Cruise vessels

28;Rapid acquisition method for structural strength evaluation stresses of the ship digital twin model;1;2023;Yuchao Liu, Huilong Ren;Ocean Engineering;The existing ship hull structure stress monitoring can only give the stress state of typical measuring points, but the monitoring point may not be the most dangerous location of the ship hull structure. To solve this problem, this paper carried out the research of ship strength digital twin. Concretely, to meet the real-time requirements for obtaining the structural stress state, this paper proposed a rapid acquisition method for structural strength evaluation stresses of the ship digital twin model, which realizes the rapid acquisition for structural yield strength evaluation stresses at the monitoring point and the non-monitoring point. To illustrate the specific application and application effect of the proposed method, the amidships three compartments section of a 21,000TEU ultra-large container ship was selected as the research object. And the case that this research object may suffer from the vertical wave bending moment and the horizontal wave bending moment simultaneously was considered. Related studies show that the proposed method can accurately recognize the load actually suffered by the ship monitoring structure. And the specific meaning of the ship monitoring structure referred to here is the ship hull structure that requires structural stress state monitoring. At the same time, related studies also show that the maximum error of the calculation results obtained by the proposed method does not exceed 0.0005% in obtaining the structural yield strength evaluation stress at the monitoring point, while the maximum calculation error does not exceed 0.032% in obtaining the structural yield strength evaluation stress at the non-monitoring point.;Ship digital twin model, Load recognition, Monitoring point and non-monitoring point, Structural strength evaluation stress, Rapid acquisition
29;A digital twin approach for maritime carbon intensity evaluation accounting for operational and environmental uncertainty;0;2023;Nikolaos Vasilikis, Rinze Geertsma, Andrea Coraddu ;Ocean Engineering;Maritime industry has set ambitious goals to drastically reduce its greenhouse gas emissions through stipulating and enforcing a number of energy assessment measures. Unfortunately, measures like the EEDI, EEXI, SEEMP and CII do not account for the operational and environmental uncertainty of operations at sea, even though they do provide a first means of evaluating the carbon footprint of ships. The increasing availability of high-frequency operational data offers the opportunity to quantify and account for this uncertainty in energy performance predictions. Current methods to evaluate and predict energy performance at a whole energy system level do not sufficiently account for operational and environmental uncertainty. In this work, we propose a digital twin that accurately predicts the fuel consumption and carbon footprint of the hybrid propulsion system of an Ocean-going Patrol Vessel (OPV) of the Royal Netherlands Navy under the aggregate effect of operational and environmental uncertainty. It combines first-principle steady-state models with machine learning algorithms to reach an accuracy of less than 5% MAPE on both mechanical and electrical propulsion, while bringing a 40% to 50% improvement over a model that does not utilise machine learning algorithms. Results over actual voyage intervals indicate a prediction accuracy of consumed fuel and carbon intensity within 2.5% accounting for a confidence interval of 95%. Finally, the direct comparison between mechanical and electrical propulsion showed no clear energy-saving benefits and a strong dependency of the results on each voyage’s specific operational and environmental conditions.;Digital twin, Carbon intensity, Operational uncertainties, Environmental uncertainties, Data-driven methods, Hybrid propulsion

31;On application of digital twin in ship operation and performance;0;2022;Munkeby, Simon Krogstad;NTNU Open;Shipping is a growing industry and is today responsible for over 90% of world trade. Tight schedules while in port and long travelling distances are common aspects of transportation, and hence efficiency is very important to maintain maximum profit. One of the most important factors to maintain profitability is to reduce operational downtime. Methods for predicting these events can be developed to prevent unwanted repairs and shutdowns. Condition monitoring is a strategy which involves monitoring the condition of physical components located on e.g. a vessel. If irregularities in vibration data or temperature are discovered, condition-based maintenance can be performed on the relevant components before the failure happens. This reduces the maintenance cost as well as increases operational up-time. To predict future failures, three different modelling methods are typically used. Data-driven modelling uses datasets and machine learning technology to develop a model by either using classification or regression algorithms. Physics-based modelling is a mathematical representation of an asset which uses common physical characteristics to simulate its behaviour. An approach combining these two condition-based methods is called hybrid modelling. A model gathering real-time data for monitoring the condition of a physical asset is called a Digital Twin. A Digital Twin is a digital representation of an object. This technology is gradually getting more attention within several industries. In this thesis, a data-driven model is developed to predict fuel oil consumption per day for marine vessels, which directly correlates to the power output, a relevant parameter in the context of machinery conditions. Several regression models have been trained based on data from four of Gearbulk's vessels. Data from a fifth vessel has been used as test data to validate the accuracy of the model. A ranking of the ten best algorithms showed a low RMSE for both the training and test dataset. The results showed a clear correlation between fuel oil consumption per day and the predictor parameters. The accuracy was higher on the test dataset which indicates a potential overfitted model. This can however be solved by adjusting the data handling and training method. The use of condition monitoring systems and digital twins are increasing in popularity within the maritime industry, but the technology is not yet flawless. It is important to understand how the technology works before it is implemented to maximise its potential.;
32;A digital twin framework for real-time ship routing considering decarbonization regulatory compliance;3;2023;Qikun Wei, Yan Liu, You Dong, Tianyun Li, Wei Li ;Ocean Engineering;International Marine Organization is promoting stricter carbon emission reduction targets, and the influx of environmental regulations presents compliance risks for maritime sector. Stakeholders need to take decarbonization performance indicators into account in ship routing to maintain regulatory compliance. To meet decarbonization goals, a decision support method related to environmental regulatory compliance is necessary for voyage optimization. To this end, this paper presents a digital twin-enabled framework for real-time decarbonization regulatory compliance prognosis in ship routing. The proposed framework tracks real-time carbon intensity and identifies opportunities for reducing operational risks associated with decarbonization goals. The digital twin approach leverage real-time environmental and operational data for improved estimation of vessel-specific regulatory compliance probability along the voyage. An improved dynamic programming algorithm is used for ship routing. The presented framework is versatile in dealing with various decarbonization regulations to provide routing decision support. An illustrated case of a container ship sailing across the South China sea is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the framework.;Digital twin, Decarbonization regulations, Ship routing, Regulatory compliance
33;Reshaping Digital Twin in Technology Developments for Enhancing Marine Systems Design;1;2022;"Jose Jorge Garcia Agis; Per Olaf Brett; Stein Ove Erikstad; Henrique Gaspar";SNAME 14th International Marine Design Conference;"The digital twin technology platform has not yet achieved the expected acceptance and wider implementation in the maritime industry. So far, most of the focus of the digital twin application discussions have centred around what to learn from big data in ship operation, and to a lesser extent, has anybody extended this discussion to include the benefits such new technology can contribute to the enhancement of the upstream ship concept and basic design activities, as well as detailed engineering. This paper particularly pays attention to this latter, partly forgotten, application area. There could be many reasons behind such a reluctance to take on new technology and utilize it to its full potential. It is hypothesized and argued by this article that the development has focused on applications that are too complex, too expensive and reflect, to a little extent, real-life needs. Lack of effective data transfer and transaction interphases among relevant stakeholders is another important factor creating these inefficiencies.  This paper document how and why such inefficiencies in novel digitization technology adoption and adaptation exist and hamper the progress of achieving noticeable benefits of such implementations and how such development hurdles can be eliminated.

Real-life user cases and several contributions in the professional literature suggest that more effective implementation of digital twin technology requires further discussions and investigations relating to three important aspects: i) a common and accepted definition of what is a digital twin; ii) an agreed-upon scalable and systemic approach to what is the solution space for a digital twin solution and iii) which systemic method to be used for digital twin development. Digital-twin technology must combine effective ship in operation and ship design feedback and feed forwarding, including their inherent people involvement and market behaviour.  This article reviews the status of digital twin technology in the maritime domain and proposes a common definition of the digital twin. The latter part of the article proposes a systemic perspective for effective digital twin development and a method for a goal-oriented digital twin development in the novel ship design domain as well for ships in operations. Real-life user-case examples are elaborated upon to support our suggestions for improvement.

The paper summarizes that, in its current form, the success rate of the digital twin technology implementation is so far, limited.  Thus, the short- and long-term benefits to be achieved from digital twin applications in relation to vessel operations and their designs are also limited.

35;Acquisition method of evaluation stress for the digital twin model of ship monitoring structure;6;2022;Yuchao Liu, Huilong Ren;Applied Ocean Research;There is a difference between the monitoring range of the sensor and the range required by the strength evaluation of ship hull structure, where the specific meaning of the range here is the length. At the same time, there may also be a difference in the stress form between the stress monitoring data obtained from the sensor and the structural stress data used for the strength evaluation of ship hull structure. As a result, one cannot apply the stress monitoring data directly to the strength evaluation of the digital twin model for the ship monitoring structure. To solve the above problem, this paper proposed a local stress correlation method, which can be used to obtain the structural stress data suitable for the specific strength evaluation of the digital twin model for the ship monitoring structure from stress monitoring data. In particular, a 21,000TEU ultra-large container ship was chosen as the targeted ship in this paper, and attention was paid to its yield stress state. Related studies have verified the feasibility of the local stress correlation method proposed in this paper. And related studies also indicate that the local stress correlation method can accurately obtain the evaluation stress for the digital twin model of the ship monitoring structure. And thus, the misjudgment of the real stress state for ship monitoring structure caused by the direct application of the stress monitoring data can be effectively avoided.;

38;A Standards-Based Approach to Modelling of Digital Twin Ship Data - Assessment of current standards and methods for future standardisation;2;2022;Fonseca, Ícaro Aragao;NTNU open;"The popularisation of sensors, internet of things, and data analysis tools is bringing opportunities for several industries to improve their products and processes. One of the concepts making use of such opportunities is the digital twin, a comprehensive simulation of an engineering system that receives updated data from that system to mirror and predict its behaviour. In the ship domain, development of comprehensive digital twins finds obstacles in the lack of interoperability among digital tools and their formats. This thesis investigates use of standards to model digital twin ships with the aim of enabling data exchanges among systems, i.e., a standards-based approach.
The work begins by investigating challenges to digital twin standardisation from the perspective of previous initiatives in the ship industry, comparisons with other sectors, and emerging trends. A few drivers are identified to guide future standardisation attempts: pragmatism in scope, support to heterogeneous systems, openness, and intelligibility. Following from these drivers, the study identifies existing standards covering the domains of ship visualisation, sensor logs, and taxonomies for ship data. They are applied to develop a web-based digital twin of an experiment in a wave basin, taking advantage of the broad support offered to web standards. The case study delimits standardisation gaps in the domains of ship models, with its accompanying metadata, and simulation of ship behaviour in operation. Both of them are taken as motivation for following research stages. The first topic is addressed by extending the open source Vessel.js library, originally developed for conceptual ship design, to handle detailed vessel models suitable for digital twins. This is done with a flexible framework which allows mapping of digital twin data to existing ship taxonomies during both design and operation. The framework is applied to a case study with a research vessel, demonstrating advantages and uncovering obstacles to scaling. The second topic is partially handled through development of functionalities for simulation and visualisation of wave motion response in Vessel.js. The library is used to develop several responsive, real-time applications combining simpler models executed on the browser and results from complex analyses, executed with external software.
The work contributed to digital twin ship interoperability in two manners: by demonstrating the current state of standardisation and introducing novel methods to inform future initiatives. Given the digital twin’s ambitious scope, the latter leaves open topics for further research, such as effective simulation-based decision-support during ship operations, accounting for interaction with sensor streams in real-time.";
39;Data Driven Digital Twin Applications Towards Green Ship Operations;4;2022;Mahmood Taghavi, Lokukaluge Prasad Perera;ASME 2022 41st International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering;Due to the growing rate of energy consumption and its consequent emissions, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has devised strict rules for an extensive reduction in Greenhouse Emissions (GHG), which forces the shipping industry to search for more energy-efficient solutions. Therefore, alongside with the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI), improving the energy efficiency of existing ships under the Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (EEXI) is of considerable importance. This paper address this issue by proposing a digital twin framework supported by big data analytics for ship performance monitoring. The proposed framework is developed by the respective data sets from a selected vessel. For this purpose, a cluster analysis is implemented using the Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) with the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. By this approach, the most frequent operating regions of the engine is detected, the shapes of these frequent operating regions are captured, and the relationships between different navigation and performance parameters of the engine are determined. That will make the basis for a digital twin application in shipping. The main objective of this research study is to develop a digital twin of a marine engine by considering the engine operational conditions that can be utilized toward green ship operations. The contribution of this paper and the outcomes can facilitate the shipping industry to meet the IMO requirements enforced by its regulations.;digital twins, machine learning, big data analytics, energy efficiency, maritime engineering, ship performance monitoring

by the improvement of data handle in respect to the communication, acquiring and
storage factors. Even those some solutions started to rise, the web platforms available
in the industrial sector, including the maritime, are still scarcity. In that sense, this
project proposes one open source solution for ship simulation and analysis that could
be evaluated as alternative.
The proposed web platform architecture uses a set of open source tools that together provide an end-to-end framework for building dynamic web applications. This
approach of architecture enhance the modularity aspect of the platform, turning easy
the adaptation, innovation and expansion of the internal modules.
One concern that was handled by the web platform was the management of complex
data from ship design and operation. The idea is to use analysis and simulations in
those two different phases to validate or improve the models. The web platform will
adopt a set of modules to present the information contextualized for each type of
the project, adapting itself to show only the applicable information depending on the
phase evaluated (design or operation).
On the project phase, the platform runs inside the Preliminary Ship Design (PSD)
theory that runs more into a holistic instead of sequential methodology. In the design phase the ship can be displayed in the initial and detailing mode. For the initial design
the display shows a building block perspective, assessing the main components and
its spaces with an initial definition for the location. In the detailing design a more
definitive form is presented, with its components divided according to the Vessel Information System (VIS) taxonomy with a tree filter that helps to identify the main
components. For the operation phase, the platform permits to stream the location of
the ship through the time, using a three dimensional visualization, the value can be
contrasted with the Maneuvering modeling developed during this project.
An essential aspect for an open platform is the ability to allow collaboration between
several partners. This report shows three practical ways related to each tier in the platform architecture for collaboration, showing its features and presenting study cases
the collaboration can be used to enhance ship simulation and analysis. This report
also uses the creation of the Maneuvering model as background to show how to expand the platform through the back end collaboration.
Finally, the report evaluate critically the project, raising important aspects regarding
the limitations of the platform, suggesting improvements and future tasks that will
improve the platform user experience.";
41;Digital Twin-Driven Approach for Process Management and Traceability towards Ship Industry;9;2022;Kan Wang,Qianqian Hu,Jialin Liu;processes;The digital twin (DT) approach has risen in popularity for applications in many industrial process managements. By applying the “Shipyard 4.0” digital transformation trend, the ship industry is developing techniques able to reduce risks by improving operation process management. This study proposes a combination of a DT approach and practical experiment as part of a five-tier framework for DT-driven process management in the ship industry. This study focuses on the characteristic scenarios and crucial parameters within the ship engine system and shipping cargo container in operation procedures. DT-based models and platforms are established in this study based on the basic modeling of Maya and scene rendering of Unity 3D. To address the fusion issue of multi-source heterogeneous data in the ship operation process, a Bayesian neural network (BNN) method is introduced into DT’s virtual model layer and data support layer. By integrating an improved BNN-based algorithm into DT-based models, the collected data can be extracted and aggregated accordingly. In the ship engine room, the operating temperature is selected as a critical parameter, with the best mean percentage deviation (MPD) between DT-driven predictions and test value of 3.18%. During the shipping cargo container process, the results indicate that DT-based models have acceptable performances under different conditions, with optimal MPDs of 5.22%.;" digital twin; process management; BNN; DT-driven prediction; ship industry"

Eng.;Using digital twins in voyage performance evaluation is becoming critical for ocean vessels to reduce GHG emissions. A novel GBM approach is proposed in this paper to establish a digital twin model for voyage performance prediction. The weather hindcast data are introduced to enrich noon reports (NR) and automatic identification system (AIS) datasets, which are split into training and validation sets to develop GBM. The NR and AIS datasets collected from a 57000DWT bulk carrier are used to demonstrate the fidelity and capability of the proposed GBM. The voyage performance prediction from the GBM shows better accuracy than those from pure WBM or pure BBMs. An arrival time forecast and a weather routing showcase are also presented to demonstrate the application effects of GBM. The proposed GBM provides a satisfying prediction of ship speed and fuel consumption without mandatory sensor-collected data, thus applicable for a varity of vessels. In those cases where more sensors are available onboard, the proposed approach can incorporate sensor data to improve the model accuracy further.;

The model is an end-to-end simulation of a ship from prime mover to maneuvering, seakeeping, and propeller ventilation in random waves representing the behavior of a physical ship. There is a trend towards increasingly networked sensors and actuators to enable condition monitoring, ensure efficient operation, and allow for autonomy. However, a cyberattack on a networked control system presents not just the possibility of information theft but of physical system damage and loss of control. Thus, a detection scheme is proposed for cyber-physical systems using a joint unscented Kalman filter. It is employed to detect cyberattacks in the simulation model of an electric ship including sensor attacks and controller attacks on a gas turbine, synchronous generator, and automatic heading control.

Some examples can include performance analysis due to degradation of the hull, rudder, or thruster; decision support for maintenance scheduling; or even distance monitoring.

The paper focuses on real-time estimation of the main vessel hydrodynamic coefficients — namely the drift and resistance coefficients — through ship motion measurements (obtained from GNSS and Gyrocompass) and the input commands to the propeller and rudder.

Compared to the previous (OMAE2021-62899), we included proper propeller and rudder models; replaced the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) with the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) and estimated the coefficients directly instead of its linear approximation.

Some maneuvers were tested within a simulated environment called pyDyna — a ship maneuvering simulator implemented on python based on the mathematical model adopted in the TPN-USP Ship Maneuvering Simulation Center. Data from motion sensors were mimicked by inducing a Gaussian white noise in the data retrieved from the simulator in real-time intending to better represent a real-world scenario.

Nejad;Journal of Physics: Conference Series;This paper presents some aspects of the risk and challenges associated with digital twin implementation in the marine industry by learning from the aviation industry where the digital twin is more widely employed. The digital twin applications in aviation and marine industries are presented and the main steps of developing a digital twin are discussed. The three main steps of sensors (measurements), model, and data analysis are identified and used in the study. The lessons from two recent accidents in the aviation industry (Boeing 737 MAX crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia in 2018 and 2019) are studied in details and discussed. It was found that the sensor reliability, model failure and wrong decisions as the output of the data processing are among the risks associated with digital twin implementations. In particular, from the case study accidents, it was found that the digital twin may not be able to represent all the possible scenarios which a system may experience in its life time. The digital twin presents many advantages, however the implementation of the digital twin is associated with risk and high uncertainties, even in the industries like the aviation industry, where the digital twin is well established and at a higher advanced level than in the marine industry.;
48;Towards a digital twin approach for vessel-specific fatigue damage monitoring and prognosis;32;2022;Eric VanDerHorn, Zhenghua Wang, Sankaran Mahadevan;Reliability Engineering & System Safety;This paper proposes a Digital Twin approach for the monitoring and prognosis of vessel-specific fatigue damage. During design, fatigue damage estimates are based on conservative assumptions regarding operational conditions and structural response. However, variability in the vessel-specific operations from those assumed during design needs to be considered when supporting engineering-based decisions for maintenance deferrals and service life extensions. The use of Digital Twins is proposed to provide this necessary vessel-specific decision support. Digital Twins typically rely on sensor-based data to update their models, however structural health sensors for fatigue monitoring can be prohibitively expensive to install and maintain in ship structures, so the proposed method addresses this by instead combining publicly available vessel-specific operational data (global vessel position data coupled with metocean hindcast data) with computational models to monitor the environmental exposure and track the vessel fatigue accumulation over time. This approach is demonstrated through a case study of a containership that has been in operation for seven years. The results of proposed approach are compared against the fatigue estimate obtained using the design reference wave conditions. The Digital Twin is then used to forecast the remaining fatigue life, in order to support inspection and maintenance scheduling and operational decision-making.;

In the maritime domain, conventional approaches have relied on mathematical modeling (e.g., linearised equations of motion) and heavy computations for estimating ship resistance and propulsion, seakeeping and maneuverability and overall hull form optimization, treating the vessel as a point body. For instance, the ability to predict a vessel’s future track in confined or congested waters presents a significant challenge due to the fact that as time passes, these models often fall out of sync with their digital counterparts due to changes that happen to the ship (e.g., foulding affecting maneuverability). In addition to this, mostly due to computational resources required, in real world deployments models are simplified, thus reducing their overall prediction accuracy. In our work, we implement AI-enabled coupled abstractions of the asset-twin system, which rely on machine learning methods for constant learning of the evolving over time behavior of a vessel based on historical trip data and information related to vessel’s structure and loading capacity. The evaluation results indicate that the inclusion of vessel and journey specific information is beneficial for the predictions.;

It is necessary to define architectures (storage in the cloud), type of deployment (up to what extend the ship should be sensorized), use or not of open-source platforms, scalability, etc. The physical part connected to the virtual part, with the first sending real data to the second part, allows reliable predictions of the behavior of equipment and systems on board. The digital twin seeks to virtually reproduce the functions of the ship systems, as well as all the conditions involved in the ship's mission (route to follow, maintenance times, modes of navigation and sea conditions).

Sandes Ianagui, Pedro Cardozo de Mello, Eduardo Aoun Tannuri;ASME 2021 40th International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering;"Retrieving certain hydrodynamics coefficients from a marine craft during a maneuver can be useful for various reasons, such as the validation of project specifications or the rapid verification of structural changes that could impact the vessel movement. Intended to estimate some of these parameters, the present work proposes a method purely based on traditional Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) focused for limited drift angles.

Albeit not posing as a replacement to conventional estimations, such as from Computer Fluid Dynamics (CFD) — which solve equations in order of millions — and experimental tests — with its time-consuming preparation setups and post-analyses — the method can possibly present itself as a convenient and quicky technique to estimate the hydrodynamics coefficients in real time, as each iteration resorts only into a few dozen of equations.

Preliminary results in the simulated environment called pyDyna — a python version of the Numerical Offshore Tank ship maneuvering simulator — indicate this procedure is faster along with an acceptable margin of accuracy, possibly pointing as a feature for future digital twin applications.";hydrodynamic derivatives, EKF, digital twin

In terms of total incidents in the shipping industry in the last five years, failures relating to the propulsion system represent the majority. Condition monitoring offers effective early detection of failure which translates to increased reliability and decreased maintenance costs. Current industrial practices are often limited to performance monitoring rather than condition monitoring. Special focus is afforded to how condition monitoring is implemented on board ships, which regulatory codes are relevant and the summary of state-of-the-art research in marine machinery. Moreover, operation and monitoring in extreme environmental conditions, such as the Arctic and Antarctic with ice impact on the propulsion has been discussed.

56;Integrated Ship Energy Flowchart: A digital twin to mitigate GHG emissions;0;2023;"Elias Elias Yfantis; Constantina Ioannou; Andreas Paradeisiotis";SNAME 8th International Symposium on Ship Operations, Management and Economics;The alarming rate of climate change accentuates the need to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions produced from anthropogenic activities and consequently the consumption of fossil fuels. The transportation sector is one of the most energy-demanding activities, consisting around 27% of the global primary energy demand and one of the major contributors of GHG emissions to the atmosphere, while shipping transportation accounts for nearly 12% of its CO2 emissions. Decarbonization is vital for emission mitigation using innovative technologies, policies, and incentives at a local and international level. In this context, the presented Integrated Ship Energy Flowchart (ISEF), aims to create a digital twin of a ship and carry out deterministic calculations, such as engine power requirements and by extension fuel consumption and emissions, by modelling the various components of a ship’s energy flow. Most modeling approaches depend on tracking data from automatic identification systems (AIS) and commercial vessel databases, accompanied with prohibitive costs for many, as well as missing vessel characteristics. ISEF, on the other hand, aims to fill in the gap in case of missing or costly to obtain data while maintaining the flexibility to utilize field data if available. This is done by providing representative vessel characteristics, detailed engine modeling and simulating components such as environmental conditions (sea-state, wind). At the same time, ISEF develops a library of vessel data including ship particulars, engine and route information among others. Thus, it is also suitable for the validation of tracking information and machine learning or other deterministic algorithms. Additionally, this library will enable the development of a statistically representative ship describing the international fleet. This will therefore improve projection algorithms utilized in calculations and aid the evaluation of mitigation options regarding decarbonisation in terms of the overall fleet. Such a model also enables the investigation of alternative fuels and fuel mixtures, route optimization, and inclusion of cold ironing amongst others. The current objectives include the validation of the core modelling implementation via comparisons with available raw data to serve as a reference case and build the necessary libraries. Therefore, a case study of a specific ship utilizing real navigational data will be used to demonstrate the capabilities of the algorithm.;asia government, djibouti government, engine, marine transportation, eritrea government, saudi arabia government, yemen government, machine learning, andreas paradeisiotis, air emission

Duong ;Scientific Reports volume ;Numerous ports worldwide are adopting automation to boost productivity and modernize their operations. At this point, smart ports become a more important paradigm for handling increasing cargo volumes and increasing operational efficiency. In fact, as ports become more congested and cargo volumes increase, the need for accurate navigation through seaports is more pronounced to avoid collisions and the resulting consequences. To this end, digital twin (DT) technology in the fifth-generation (5G) networks and drone-assisted data collection can be combined to provide precise ship maneuvering. In this paper, we propose a DT model using drone-assisted data collection architecture, called TwinPort, to offer a comprehensive port management system for smart seaports. We also present a recommendation engine to ensure accurate ship navigation within a smart port during the docking process. The experimental results reveal that our solution improves the trajectory performance by approaching the desired shortest path. Moreover, our solution supports significantly reducing financial costs and protecting the environment by reducing fuel consumption.;

The proposed DSS assesses the resilience of a port under possible disruptive events given its design, operations and potential pre-defined post-event recovery actions to mitigate the impact of the disruption. Digital twinning provides the fidelity required to realistically predict port performance with taken post-event recovery actions under various possible disruptive events. In addition to hedging against impacts from probabilistically known disruption events, this approach also enables inclusion of ordinary operational uncertainties within the resilience evaluation. This is not generally feasible with other existing resilience quantification approaches. To tackle computational challenges of applying a digital twin for real-world size applications, an optimal computing budget allocation policy is adopted to improve computational efficiency. Results of numerical experiments using a real-world size port demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DSS and criticality of accounting for ordinary uncertainties in operations in resilience estimation.;Port resilience, digital-twinning-driven analytics, decision support systems, port performance,simulation-optimization, maritime transport

Ideally, the models used in a digital twin only rely on current in-service data, although they have been built using simulated and possibly some measured data. Working with just the 6-DOF motions of a ship, can the local sea state reliably be estimated using the digital twin concept? Does a general model exist to do so, without the need to measure or simulate the particular ship?

In this paper, we discuss how simulations of an advancing ship, subjected to various sea states, can be used to estimate the relative wave direction from in-service motion measurements of the corresponding ship. Various types of neural networks are used and evaluated with simulated data and measured data. In order to study the generalization power of the neural networks, a range of ships has been simulated, with varying lengths, drafts and geometries. Neural networks have been trained on selections of the ships in this extended training set and evaluated on the remaining ships.

Results show that the developed neural networks give a remarkable performance in simulation data. Furthermore, generalization over geometry is very good, opening the door to train a general model for estimating sea state characteristics. Using the same model for in-service measurements does not perform well enough yet and further research is required.

Therefore, the possibility of integrating the Markovian-framework-based finite-state method into the context of ship production is presented in this study, including its outline, digital thread, and factory-floor data reliance. First, the predictive analytics problem is addressed by the finite-state method in the case of the shipyard’s fabrication line, and the obtained results are validated afterward using a numerical model through discrete-event theory. The predictive analytics indicate an almost ideal balancing of the fabrication line, except for the buffers storing stiffeners before the coat-dying and marking operations.

67;Development of a diesel engine’s digital twin for predicting propulsion system dynamics;43;2020;Oleksiy Bondarenko, Tetsugo Fukuda;Energy;A digital twin is the essential part of a recent and unavoidable trend in ship operation digitalisation. The digital twin is a virtual replica of real ship or a particular system that coexists with its physical counterpart and maps the dynamic behaviour in real-time. Thus, the digital twin combines physical space real-time data with a set of dynamic models representing the physical counterpart in the cyberspace. The problem of digital twin development is a trade-off between insight into the dynamic process and real-time execution constraint. This paper describes a modelling approach that combines continuous time-domain cycle-mean value engine model with the crank-angle resolved phenomenological combustion model, satisfying the real-time execution constraint. The set of conservation laws, notably energy and mass, supplemented with the phenomenological Wiebe combustion model, is treated in the integral form allowing transformation into a set of nonlinear algebraic equations. The solution of the resulting system exhibits fast speed and accuracy as compared with the traditional approach combining differential equations and Runge-Kutta solver.;

Torsional vibration was detected by measuring the twist of the shafts and by utilizing torque transducers. Analysis of the measurement data indicated that the lowest resonance frequencies of the test bench were similar to full-scale thrusters. The revealed dynamic properties suggested by the measurement data enabled the test bench to be concluded as adequate for emulating the torsional dynamics of the full-scale thrusters.

The effect of using separate wave spectra for wind waves and swell on performance prediction has been explored. The importance of the peak enhancement factor(γ) in the JONSWAP spectrum for added resistance computation has been studied. Simulation model including calm water resistance, added resistance and wind resistance has been used. Ships have been simulated in the same weather conditions and propeller speed as in the case of full-scale ships using different methods for added resistance. The performance of these methods has been quantified by comparing speed and power predictions with the full-scale data. The paper also discusses the challenges involved in using full-scale data for such a comparison because of difficulty in isolating the effect of added resistance in full-scale data.

It was observed that three out of five methods were able to predict added resistance even in high waveheights. Even though these methods showed significantly different RAOs, its effect on speed and power prediction was minor. Simulation results were not sensitive to the choice of peak enhancement factor(γ) in the JONSWAP spectrum.

Therefore, the global maritime industry puts every effort into reducing carbon emissions in the shipping chain, which includes vessel fleets, ports, terminals, and hinterland transportation. A representative example is the carbon emission reduction standard mandated by the International Maritime Organization for international sailing ships to reduce carbon emissions this year. Among the decarbonization tools, the most immediate solution for reducing carbon emissions is to reduce vessel waiting time near ports and increase operational efficiency. The operation efficiency improvement in maritime stakeholders’ port operations can be achieved using data. This data collection and operational efficiency improvement can be realized using a digital twin. This study develops a digital twin that measures and reduces carbon emissions using the collaborative operation of maritime stakeholders. In this study, the authors propose a data structure and backbone scheduling algorithm for a port digital twin. The interactive scheduling between a port and its vessels is investigated using the digital twin. The digital twin’s interactive scheduling for the proposed model improved predictions of vessel arrival time and voyage carbon emissions.

75;Concept design of a digital twin architecture for ship structural health management;0;2022;Zhiping Cheng, Eric Tan, Minbo Cai and Allan Ross Magee;J. Phys.: Conf. Ser.;Ocean-going vessels frequently experience severe weather conditions. Occasionally, the actual environmental loads are much larger than design values, resulting in deviations from design conditions that may cause serious structural damage. A structural digital twin can enhance predictability and reliability of marine structures, and thus provide vessel operators, owners, and stakeholders with a more accurate overview of a vessel's condition. It can also help reduce lifecycle costs through proposing rational and optimal inspection, maintenance, repair programs, and assist on maximizing service life and mission availability. This paper uses a benchmark vessel to investigate structural behaviors of the vessel through dynamic loading approach. The correlation between structure members and critical responses are established, and high stress concentration areas have been identified. Subsequently, this paper develops a conceptual digital twin architecture. The proposed digital twin predicts responses of the entire structure to measured or predicted environmental conditions with a hybrid model combining numerical simulations with measurements. While the traditional structural monitoring system focuses on the health condition of typical hot spots, the proposed digital twin may improve structural health awareness of the entire hull structure based on a limited number of sensors.;

Maritime cranes are constantly exposed to severe loads, obtaining a wide range of failure modes, most related to structural factors and can be predicted by a digital twin. This project aims to develop a digital twin model to provide the crane with real-time structural monitoring that would constantly measure the structure status and loads, making possible the prediction of operations and capabilities by mixing the digital twin with data from sensors mounted in the physical crane.

79;Applications of Digital Twin across Industries: A Review;59;2022;Maulshree Singh,Rupal Srivastava,Evert Fuenmayor,Vladimir Kuts, Yuansong Qiao,Niall Murray and Declan Devine ;applied sciences;One of the most promising technologies that is driving digitalization in several industries is Digital Twin (DT). DT refers to the digital replica or model of any physical object (physical twin). What differentiates DT from simulation and other digital or CAD models is the automatic bidirectional exchange of data between digital and physical twins in real-time. The benefits of implementing DT in any sector include reduced operational costs and time, increased productivity, better decision making, improved predictive/preventive maintenance, etc. As a result, its implementation is expected to grow exponentially in the coming decades as, with the advent of Industry 4.0, products and systems have become more intelligent, relaying on collection and storing incremental amounts of data. Connecting that data effectively to DTs can open up many new opportunities and this paper explores different industrial sectors where the implementation of DT is taking advantage of these opportunities and how these opportunities are taking the industry forward. The paper covers the applications of DT in 13 different industries including the manufacturing, agriculture, education, construction, medicine, and retail, along with the industrial use case in these industries.;"Digital Twin; Industry 4.0; Smart Manufacturing; system optimization; predictive maintenance"
80;Methodology for Selection of Co-Simulation Platform for Digital Twin Development of Maritime Energy Systems;0;2023;Vaidehi Gosala, Ludger Hachmeister, Sophie Stutz, Jan-Erik Giering, Sören Ehlers;ASME 2023 42nd International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering;Digital twins (DTs) are being increasingly considered in the maritime industry for the purposes of system design, monitoring, control, optimization, operational planning, maintenance, fault detection, and life cycle management. A system simulation can be utilized to enable many of these functionalities. Co-simulation based on the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) is typically used to interface component models independently developed in different modelling platforms, possibly having different supplier intellectual property restrictions. Currently, more than 170 software tools support FMI, a subset of which also support co-simulation. In this paper, a methodology for the selection of a co-simulation platform for a maritime DT is presented. The methodology is demonstrated for two maritime energy system case studies with different DT purposes and users, that represent different phases of a ship’s lifecycle. MATLAB/Simulink and Open Simulation Platform (OSP) are used as example co-simulation platforms. The DT’s purpose and its users are considered to understand the functional and interface requirements for a qualitative comparison of the platforms. Additionally, the platforms’ performance is compared quantitatively by co-simulating Functional Mock-up Units (FMUs) of the component models. The derived requirements, as well as the platforms’ capabilities and offerings, are then analyzed to select a suitable platform. It is shown that the choice of the co-simulation platform can be different according to the DT’s purpose, users, and phase of the ship’s and DT’s lifecycle.;digital twins, simulation, co-simulation, maritime energy systems

82;Online Digital Twin and a Decision Support for Safe Maneuvering of R/V Gunnerus;0;2023;Sanchez Martin, Luis Fernando;NTNU open;"This thesis will present the development of an online digital twin for NTNU's Research Vessel Gunnerus. Maritime digital twins are becoming a more and more prevalent technology used for the development, maintenance, and evolution of maritime vessels. A digital twin is at its core a virtual representation of a physical asset, it can simulate the interaction of the diverse systems involved in the operation of its real-life counterpart and combine them with available sensor data. As such, a digital twin can accompany a vessel from its early stages of development, going then through the integration of additional systems, testing of new implementations, monitoring of the real vessel, and its maintenance.
The focus of this work is on displaying real-time information coming from Gunnerus for the purposes of vessel monitoring and decision support for safe navigation. To this effect, a backend implementation has been developed for interfacing with the real-time data stream coming from Gunnerus. This backend will then be used to provide processed data to the applications in charge of vessel monitoring and decision support for safe navigation. These applications will be implemented as a 3D visualization based on the Autoferry Gemini simulator, and a 2D electronic chart web application, both conveying information related to Gunnerus and the surrounding vessels. Furthermore, the 2D electronic chart will display information regarding the decision support for safe navigation. This decision support system will use real-time data in order to display parameters from automatic radar plotting aids related to nearby vessels. Additionally, a safe trajectory based on control barrier functions will be displayed in the same chart as a suggestion for safe navigation for the officer on watch.
The capabilities of the resulting framework for an online digital twin of Gunnerus will be demonstrated with examples based on real data collected through its development.";

In general, the virtual model representations of the physical objects are created in the DT manner to simulates the characteristics and behaviors of the real-word system. Applying a supervisory system not only can reduce the failures of components, but also preserve the overall costs associated with the system at a minimum. This paper reviews the DT applications in the power system, while its advantages in wind turbines, solar panels, power electronic converter, and shipboard electrical system will be briefly discussed. The potential benefits of contemporary technologies to ameliorate the DT in the industry are studied. Besides, it provides a great technique to assess and analyze system performance.

The systems being twinned (e.g. defense, manufacturing, logistics, computer and network systems) are typically very complex and require significant effort to model and track. This paper discusses how Distributed Simulation (DS) can support DTs thanks to a network of distributed computing resources. DS can speed up the execution of simulation programs in DTs (and therefore the time taken to analyze the behavior of a system) and link together simulations to support composability and reusability during the development of DTs. A distributed real-time simulation environment based on the IEEE 1516 High Level Architecture Standard (HLA) has been developed in the case of the DT of an Underwater Unmanned Vehicles (UUV), intended to extend the ship capabilities.

86;Co-simulation as a Fundamental Technology for Twin Ships;21;2020;"Hatledal, Lars Ivar; Skulstad, Robert; Li, Guoyuan; Styve, Arne; Zhang, Houxiang";NTNU open;The concept of digital twins, characterized by the high fidelity with which they mimic their physical counterpart, provide potential benefits for the next generation of advanced ships. It allows analysis of data and monitoring of marine systems to avoid problems before they occur, and plan for the future by using simulations. However, issues related to integration of heterogeneous systems and hardware, memory, and CPU utilization makes implementing such a digital twin in a monolithic or centralized manner undesirable. Co-simulation addresses this problem, allowing different sub-systems to be modelled independently, but simulated together. This paper presents the ongoing work towards realizing a digital twin of the Gunnerus research vessel by applying co-simulation and related standards. The paper does not present a complete, ready-to-use digital twin. Rather it presents the preliminary results, procedure, and enabling technologies used towards realizing one. In order to accommodate this goal, a novel co-simulation solution, developed in cooperation by members of the Norwegian maritime industry, is presented. Furthermore, a maneuvering case-study is carried out, utilizing pre-recorded sensor data obtained from the Gunnerus. Through a comparative study with the real maneuver in terms of speed, course, and power consumption, the proposed approach is verified in simulation.;
87;Hybrid ML-EMT-Based Digital Twin for Device-Level HIL Real-Time Emulation of Ship-Board Microgrid on FPGA;0;2023;"Songyang Zhang; Tian Liang; Venkata Dinavahi"; IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Industrial Electronics ;Maritime industries desire high speed and reliability, low lifespan cost, and environmental impact shipping for transportation. Compared to highly congested land shipments and high-cost air freight, all-electric ship (AES) can reduce the lifespan energy consumption and transport a considerable freight volume at a lower rate. Recently, the medium voltage dc (MVDC) topology, recommended by IEEE standard, pushes the AES to the next stage in considering space and weight constraints with the reduction of bulky transformers and simplified parallel connections. However, device-level modeling of this massive parallel MVDC-based ship-board microgrid (SBM) is challenging to both the state-of-the-art general-purpose compute unit and traditional electromagnetic transient (EMT)-based emulation. With the rapid development of machine learning (ML) algorithm and its dedicated execution unit, accelerated parallel emulation becomes achievable in different levels of this paralleled connected SBM. Applying the ML-aided technique can help to improve the emulation execution efficiency and reduce the consumption of hardware resource on the field-programmable gate arrays.

88;Correspondence measure: a review for the digital twin standardization;0;2023;Tarique Hasan Khan, Chiho Noh & Soonhung Han ;The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology volume;This study delves into the critical issue of Digital Twin (DT) technology standardization, focusing on introducing a novel approach called “correspondence measure.” We draw upon extensive literature review and case study analyses to investigate existing standardization methods, identifying sector-specific and problem-specific strategies. We also underline the importance of interoperability, data privacy and security, real-time synchronization, and accuracy and fidelity in the standardization of DTs. Unveiling the intricacies of the “correspondence measure,” we elucidate its potential in enhancing the standardization process by providing a standardized measure of the accuracy and reliability of a digital twin concerning its physical counterpart. Furthermore, we discuss the applications of our proposed method in various sectors such as manufacturing, healthcare, aerospace, maritime and shipping, and city management. Our findings suggest that the “correspondence measure” can significantly contribute to the existing standardization approaches by facilitating a better understanding of the DT's behavior, thereby fostering trust in these digital replications. This paper not only offers a theoretical contribution to the literature on DT standardization but also provides practical insights for the stakeholders involved in developing, implementing, and managing digital twins.;Digital twin, Standardization, Spatiotemporal similarity measure, CAD

90;An abstract approach toward the structural digital twin of ship hulls: A numerical study applied to a box girder geometry;24;2021;Konstantinos N. Anyfantis;Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part M: Journal of Engineering for the Maritime Environment;Condition monitoring (CM) of ship hull structures is a promising field that has recently attracted the interested of researches. The main challenge behind CM is to develop a system that gets as input sensor readings from the structure and provide the damage locus as an output. In this regard, the current study proposes two alternative CM digital twin schemes for solving this inverse engineering problem. The first one is based on a Finite Element (FE) – Optimization cooperative framework that solves several times the model until the predicted strains match the measured ones and as such the damage location has been found. The other scheme is based on a cooperative framework of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) used for classification and fitting, that may be regarded as surrogated models which provide solutions instantaneously. The ANNs are trained through the numerical solutions provided by the FE model. A thin-walled hollow cantilever beam, that resembles a hull-girder subjected to principal stresses under vertical bending, has been adopted. The performed work has allowed for the selection and evaluation of the locations for sensor placement and the estimation of the damage sensitive area for monitoring. Both CM digital twin schemes have proven to be promising for the theoretical simplified examined case.;
91;Artificial Intelligence in Underwater Digital Twins Sensor Networks;52;2022;Zhihan Lv, Dongliang Chen, Hailin Feng, Wei Wei, Haibin Lv;ACM Transactions on Sensor Networks;The particularity of the marine underwater environment has brought many challenges to the development of underwater sensor networks (UWSNs). This research realized the effective monitoring of targets by UWSNs and achieved higher quality of service in various applications such as communication, monitoring, and data transmission in the marine environment. After analysis of the architecture, the marine integrated communication network system (MICN system) is constructed based on the maritime wireless Mesh network (MWMN) by combining with the UWSNs. A distributed hybrid fish swarm optimization algorithm (FSOA) based on mobility of underwater environment and artificial fish swarm (AFS) theory is proposed in response to the actual needs of UWSNs. The proposed FSOA algorithm makes full use of the perceptual communication of sensor nodes and lets the sensor nodes share the information covered by each other as much as possible, enhancing the global search ability. In addition, a reliable transmission protocol NC-HARQ is put forward based on the combination of network coding (NC) and hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ). In this work, three sets of experiments are performed in an area of 200 × 200 × 200 m. The simulation results show that the FSOA algorithm can fully cover the events, effectively avoid the blind movement of nodes, and ensure consistent distribution density of nodes and events. The NC-HARQ protocol proposed uses relay nodes for retransmission, and the probability of successful retransmission is much higher than that of the source node. At a distance of more than 2,000 m, the successful delivery rate of data packets is as high as 99.6%. Based on the MICN system, the intelligent ship constructed with the digital twins framework can provide effective ship operating state prediction information. In summary, this study is of great value for improving the overall performance of UWSNs and advancing the monitoring of marine data information.;

Although there is some research literature referring to digital twin (DT) solutions for specific problems in shipping, general lack of clarity on the level and direction of progress in this field has been observed by researchers. This paper tries to address exactly this question by collecting data using an opinion survey of managers of some maritime industry companies based in Greece – a country where a significant part of the global commercial fleet is being managed from. Drivers, enablers and impediments to the adoption of DT in shipping have been identified by an opinion survey. A first attempt to devise a generic cost-benefit framework for the adoption of DT solutions in shipping is presented as a key managerial decision-making tool for such a big investment needed for DT.;Digital Twins, Digital Twins In Shipping, Adoption Of Digital Twins, Maritime Applications Of Digital Twins.

They aim to create a continuously synchronized model of the physical system which enables rapid adaptation to dynamics, mainly unpredicted and undesirable changes. A wide range of industrial fields have already benefited from digital twins technology such as aerospace, manufacturing, healthcare, city management and maritime and shipping. Furthermore, recent research works are starting to study the integration of digital twins for computer networks to allow more innovation and intelligent management. One of the basic building blocks of digital twins technology is the Internet of Things where wireless sensors and actuators are deployed to ensure the interaction between the physical and digital worlds. This type of network is complex to manage due to its severe constraints especially when it controls critical industrial applications, resulting in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). We believe that the optimization of the IIoT will lead to efficient integration of Digital Twins in Industry 4.0. In this paper, we design a Network Digital Twin for the IIoT where sensors, actuators and communication infrastructure are replicated in the digital twin to enable intelligent real-time management of such networks. This way, new networking services such as predictive maintenance, network diagnosis, resource allocation, energy optimization with other intelligent services can be efficiently integrated and exploited in the network life-cycle.

96;Laying The Foundation For an Intelligence-Powered Extendable Digital Twin Framework For Autonomous Sea Vessels;0;2022;Sætre, Simon Mork;NTNU open;"Humans are the main cause of accidents at sea. It is therefore desirable in some cases to create autonomous vehicles capable of operating without any human intervention. A framework for visualisation and development of a digital twin and RL algorithms is developed in Unity Game Engine. A digital representation of the Trondheim Fjord terrain is created, where wind and rain is implemented by using real-time real world values for the area. Boats emitting AIS signals in the area are also used to create digital representations of the ships. Virtual Reality was implemented in the project which allows for both normal windowed visualisation and virtual visualisation. In addition, the Milliampere 2 boat is represented accurately in the project as a virtual object dictated by a flexible dynamical model. This dynamical model is affected by external forces like wind and two thrusters attached to the bottom of the vessel. As the real boat should have a LIDAR, a ray casting sensor array is used in the project to mimic its real counterpart. A pooling algorithm for the sensor readings is used to reduce the dimensions in the sensor from 220 to 9. This is used in an RL algorithm for controlling the
boat.
A RL algorithm using PPO is trained inside of Unity, where the goal is to follow a given path as closely as possible while avoiding obstacles like land and other boats. After RL training, the boat was given over 100 attempts to complete four paths of varying degree of difficulty. The boat had a 100% success rate on both of the paths containing no obstacles. This success rate dropped to 17% when obstacles were introduced. While the success rate was low when obstacles were introduced, it is suggested that minor changes in Unity will improve future training. A safety filter could be an good addition to ensure the RL model will not act dangerously.";
97;Sensor Control in Anti-Submarine Warfare—A Digital Twin and Random Finite Sets Based Approach;24;2019;Peng Wang,Mei Yang,Yong Peng,Jiancheng Zhu,Rusheng Ju and Quanjun Yin;entropy;"Abstract
Since the submarine has become the major threat to maritime security, there is an urgent need to find a more efficient method of anti-submarine warfare (ASW). The digital twin theory is one of the most outstanding information technologies, and has been quite popular in recent years. The most influential change produced by digital twin is the ability to enable real-time dynamic interactions between the simulation world and the real world. Digital twin can be regarded as a paradigm by means of which selected online measurements are dynamically assimilated into the simulation world, with the running simulation model guiding the real world adaptively in reverse. By combining digital twin theory and random finite sets (RFSs) closely, a new framework of sensor control in ASW is proposed. Two key algorithms are proposed for supporting the digital twin-based framework. First, the RFS-based data-assimilation algorithm is proposed for online assimilating the sequence of real-time measurements with detection uncertainty, data association uncertainty, noise, and clutters. Second, the computation of the reward function by using the results of the proposed data-assimilation algorithm is introduced to find the optimal control action. The results of three groups of experiments successfully verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.";"digital twin; anti-submarine warfare (ASW); data assimilation; online sensor control; random finite set (RFS); sequential Monte Carlo (SMC); Bayesian inference"
98;Towards a Digital Twin of a Complex Maritime Site for Multi-Objective Optimization;0;2022;"Joseph A. J. Ross; Kimberly Tam; David J. Walker; Kevin D. Jones"; 2022 14th International Conference on Cyber Conflict: Keep Moving! (CyCon);Her Majesty’s Naval Base (HMNB) Devonport is a complex maritime site in Plymouth, United Kingdom (UK). Using digital twin technology, the authors will model and simulate the physical entity of the dockyard to optimize for a set of critical priorities. Digital twins are virtual representations of a physical entity, such as a vehicle. They can fully model a complex environment, accurately modelling individual layers within the entity, with each layer accessing data required from other layers. This results in an accurate simulation so that when changes are made in one layer of the model, the impact across the other layers may be observed. An end-user could interact with this digital twin to understand how changing input parameters would affect the measured outputs, allowing the end-users to simulate different options and compare the simulated outcomes before deciding a course of action. If the digital twin is of higher fidelity, the simulated outcomes would be more accurate and demonstrate potentially unintended effects allowing for a more comprehensive overview for the decision-maker. From this digital twin, a decision-maker can manually identify the best parameters to simulate the outcomes through the digital twin. However, using multi-objective optimization can reduce this process so that the twin can create the inputs, monitor the outcomes, and repeatedly try to produce a specific number of outcomes to choose from. These outcomes would be based on a few priorities initially set, and the optimizer would change inputs to enhance each of these priorities. At HMNB Devonport, three main priorities have been identified: cost reduction, time efficiency and carbon neutrality.;digital twin,visualization,multi-objective optimization,dockyard logistics
